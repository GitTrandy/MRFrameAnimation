/* Performs `animations` using a timing curve described by the motion of a spring. When `dampingRatio` is 1, the animation will smoothly decelerate to its final model values without oscillating. Damping ratios less than 1 will oscillate more and more before coming to a complete stop. You can use the initial spring velocity to specify how fast the object at the end of the simulated spring was moving before it was attached. It's a unit coordinate system, where 1 is defined as travelling the total animation distance in a second. So if you're changing an object's position by 200pt in this animation, and you want the animation to behave as if the object was moving at 100pt/s before the animation started, you'd pass 0.5. You'll typically want to pass 0 for the velocity. */
